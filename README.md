This is an app using The Blue Alliance API to track scoring information for each team and help to prepare for events.

This is mainly for team 5041 CyBears, but I would be happy for anyone to use it.

As of right now, it currently only has the 2022 season and very minimal CSS.

In the coming month, I hope to update to project to work for the new 2023 season, make it look nicer, and make it an even more useful tool.

To make this work, you will need your own API key, which you can get from: https://www.thebluealliance.com/account/login?next=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thebluealliance.com%2Faccount

This should work very similarly to every other flask app, so here are some basic instructions:

1. In the command line, navigate to the project folder. This is done by chaning the current directory (cd)
2. In the command line, navigate into the Scripts folder in the project folder
3. In the command line, type activate.bat
4. In the command line, type "cd .."
5. In the command line, type "flask run"
6. Navigate to the IP address that is displayed in the command line in a browser.
7. Enjoy :)

Hope that this is helpful. If you have any recommendations on how this can further be improved, please let me know.
